Buy API Field Filters

Many of the Buy APIs are a (Limited Release). The use of eBay’s Buy APIs in production is intended for eBay partners only. You must apply for production access through the eBay Partner Network. Acceptance of applications is based on the proposed business model, as well as a formal agreement to abide by the policies and requirements stipulated by eBay. 

Note: There is no guarantee that your application for production use of the APIs will be approved.

## Using the APIs in sandbox

Anyone with an eBay developer account can use the Buy APIs in the sandbox with the exception of methods in the guest_checkout_session and checkout_session resources which are those methods used for guest checkout and eBay member checkout, respectively.

Developers who require access to guest checkout/eBay member checkout methods should reach out to Developer Technical Support (DTS) and/or their Business Unit contact to request approval. Once approved for production use of the Buy APIs for guest checkout and/or eBay member checkout use cases, developers will then be granted access to use the guest checkout and/or eBay member checkout methods in the sandbox as well.

We advise you to complete the Production application process and obtain approval before you invest significantly in application development and testing.

## Beta launch phase

Some of the eBay Buy APIs are currently beta releases. This means that they are subject to change and consumers may be asked to update their integration accordingly, depending upon the nature of the change. For details about the implications of different phases of eBay API releases, see API launch stages in the Using eBay RESTful APIs guide.

## Production eligibility requirements

 Users must meet standard eligibility requirements, get approvals from eBay support organizations, and sign contracts with eBay to access the Buy APIs in production. Meeting the standard eligibility requirements is not a guarantee that production access will be granted. 
 See Production access process for additional information and instructions for requesting production access.

These requirements are grouped into:

- Contractual requirements

- Technical requirements

- Application requirements for checkout

- User experience requirements for eBay guest checkouts

- Guest checkout flow requirements

### Contractual requirements

Use of the eBay APIs in production requires the following accounts:

- An eBay member account (on ebay.com) (This is required in order to use sandbox.)

- An eBay Developers Program account (This is required in order to use sandbox.)

In addition to all the contracts and agreements associated with the accounts, such as the eBay User Agreement, the API License Agreement, and the eBay Partner Network Agreement, there are contracts with eBay that are specific to the eBay Buy APIs and your business model. You may also be required to sign Mutual Non-disclosure Agreements (MNDAs) depending on your business model. Also, if you want to download the item feed files or get paid for selling eBay items, you need to become an affiliate by joining the eBay Partner Network. For additional information, see Affiliate Marketing Resources.

### Technical requirements

Depending on your use case, your application must meet one or both of the following requirements:

- Application must be fully functional and reviewable on the eBay sandbox

- Application must implement affiliate tracking details (needed for revenue share capability)

### Application requirements for checkout

There are two types of checkouts:

- The member method of the Order API. This is for eBay members who are signed in. 


The Checkout with eBay widget flow. This is for eBay guests, who are anonymous.

 The following describes the requirements for these checkout types.

#### Application requirements for eBay member checkout (Order API)

To use the checkout_session resource, which supports eBay member checkout, you need approval. This approval will give you access for member checkout in both the sandbox and production API environments. To request approval, see Production access process.

The requirements for using eBay member checkout will be communicated to you with your access approval. They will be similar to the requirements for 
 the Application requirements for eBay guest checkouts. However, there could be additional requirements, and some guest checkout requirements may not apply.

#### Application requirements for eBay guest checkouts (Checkout with eBay)

The guest_checkout_session resource lets eBay guests purchase items using the Checkout with eBay widget. This lets eBay guests purchase items by credit card, direct debit, or other payment method. 

Partners must include the following data elements within the commerce flow and adhere to all user experience requirements detailed in the tables below. 

### User experience requirements for eBay guest checkouts

The following sections list the requirements for the browse, view item, partner cart and checkout experiences by marketplace. For a list of marketplaces supported by the Buy APIs, see
